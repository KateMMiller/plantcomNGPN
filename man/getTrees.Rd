\arguments{
\item{park}{Filter on park code (aka Unit_Name). Can select more than one. Valid inputs:
\itemize{
\item{"all":} {Include all NGPN parks with FFI data}

\item{"DETO":} {Devils Tower National Monument}

\item{"SCBL":} {Scotts Bluff National Monument}
\item{"THRO":} {Theodore Roosevelt National Park}
\item{"WICA":} {Wind Cave National Park}
}}

\item{plot_name}{Quoted string to return a particular plot based on MacroPlot_Name. Default is "all", which if
purpose is set to "NGPN_PCM" (default), and project is set to "Park" (default), then only NGPN Plant Community
Monitoring plots (e.g.,macroplots with "_PCM_", "_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_" in their names) will be included.
Can select multiple plots. If a plot name is specified that does not occur in the imported data,
function will error out with a list of unmatched plot names.}

\item{project}{Quoted string to return plots of a particular project, based on ProjectUnit_Name. In NGPN, this
typically is the strata a given plot belongs to. By default, selects NGPN_PCM plots, which are plots with
c("_PCM_", "_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_") in their name and the "Park" stratum for those plots. Note that some
plots fall in multiple stratum, such as Park and Native Prairie in AGFO. In those cases, the "Park" strata is
selected by default. If a user wants a different strata than "Park", that can be specified using the codes below.
Only one project can be specified at a time. Current valid inputs:
\itemize{
\item{"Park":} {Default. *NGPN_PCM* stratum covering whole park (same.}
\item{"ABAM":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in WICA.}
\item{"Bodmer":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in FOUS.}
\item{"Fort":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in FOUS.}
\item{"Native Prairie":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in AGFO.}
\item{"North Riparian":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in THRO.}
\item{"North Upland":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in THRO.}
\item{"North Unit":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in BADL.}
\item{"Pine Forest":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in DETO, JECA, MORU, and WICA.}
\item{"Prairie":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in BADL, DETO, FOUS, KNRI, SCBL, THRO, and WICA.}
\item{"Riparian":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in AGFO, DETO, and FOLA.}
\item{"Shrubland":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in THRO.}
\item{"South Riparian":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in THRO.}
\item{"South Upland":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in THRO.}
\item{"Upland":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in DETO and FOLA.}

\item{purpose}{Quoted string to return plots with a particular purpose, which typically refers to a characteristic
of the plot's sample design in NGPN (e.g., Panel1). Note that purpose is not standard across parks. This function
standardizes some purposes (eg "FX" and "Fire Effects" are both called "FX monitoring"). The following purposes
that can be specified are below. By default, "NGPN_PCM" plots are selected, which includes all plots with c("_PCM_",
"_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_") in their name. If new purposes are added in the future, they will need to be added
to the bug handling code in the function. Valid inputs:
\itemize{
\item{"all":} {All plots in imported FFI database}
\item{"NGPN_PCM":} {Default. NGPN Plant Community Monitoring Plots with c("_PCM_", "_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and, "_RCM_") in their name, and all of the purposes defined below.}
\item{"ForestStructure":}{NGPN Forest Structure plot. Found in KNRI and WICA.}
\item{"IM_Intensive"}{NGPN intensive monitoring plot. Found in AGFO, FOUS, and THRO.}
\item{"Panel1":} {NGPN PCM Panel 1}
\item{"Panel2":} {NGPN PCM Panel 2}
\item{"Panel3":} {NGPN PCM Panel 3}

\item{"Panel10":} {NGPN PCM Panel 10}
\item{"PanelE":} {NGPN PCM Extensive. Found in DETO, FOLA, JECA, MORU, SCBL, and THRO.}
\item(""){A number of PCM plots have a blank purpose. Until this is resolved, or we know these can be dropped, they are included in the NGPN_PCM purpose}

\item{mon_status}{Quoted string. Allows you to select different MonitoringStatus$MonitoringStatus_Base types. Default is "NGPN_PCM",

Current valid inputs:
\itemize{
\item{"NGPN_PCM":} {Default. Pulls in records with monitoring status base of "PlantCommunity", "FirePlantCommunity", "ForestStructure".
Note that some base names have _, spaces, or years in them. These are cleaned up in the function until they're fixed in the database.}
\item{"PlantCommunity":} {PlantCommunity only records}
\item{"FirePlantCommunity":} {FirePlantCommunity only records}
\item{"ForestStructure":} {ForestStructure only records}
