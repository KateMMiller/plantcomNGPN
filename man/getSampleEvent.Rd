\arguments{
\item{park}{Filter on park code (aka RegistrationUnit_Name). Can select more than one. Valid inputs:
\itemize{
\item{"all":} {Include all NGPN parks with FFI data}

\item{plot_name}{Quoted string to return a particular plot based on name. Default is "all", which if
purpose is set to "NGPN_VS" (default), and project is set to "Park" (default), then only NGPN Plant Community
Monitoring plots (e.g.,macroplots with "_PCM_", "_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_" in their names) will be included.
Can select multiple plots. If a plot name is specified that does not occur in the imported data,
function will error out with a list of unmatched plot names.}

\item{project}{Quoted string to return plots of a particular project, based on ProjectUnit_Name. In NGPN, this
typically is the strata a given plot belongs to. By default, selects "NGPN_VS" plots, which are plots with
c("_PCM_", "_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_") in their name and the "Park" stratum for those plots. Note that some
plots fall in multiple stratum, such as Park and Native Prairie in AGFO. In those cases, the Park strata is
selected by default. If a user wants a different strata than "Park", that can be specified using the codes below.
Valid inputs:
\itemize{
\item{'all':} {Pull in all project types.}
\item{"Park":} {Default. *NGPN VS* stratum covering whole park.}

\item{purpose}{Quoted string to return plots with a particular purpose, which typically refers to a characteristic
of the plot's sample design in NGPN (e.g., Panel1). Note that purpose is not standard across parks. This function
standardizes some purposes (eg "FX" and "Fire Effects" are both called "FX monitoring"). The following purposes
that can be specified are below. By default, "NGPN_VS" plots are selected, which includes all plots with c("_PCM_",
"_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_") in their name.
\itemize{
\item{"all":} {All plots in imported FFI database}
\item{"NGPN_VS":} {Default. NGPN Plant Community Monitoring Plots with c("_PCM_", "_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and, "_RCM_") in their name}

\item{years}{Numeric. Filter on years. Accepted values start at 1997. Default is 2011 to current year,
which represents the time NGPN plant community monitoring began using latest protocol and sample design.}

\item{output}{Quoted string. Options are "short" (default), which only returns most important columns;
"verbose" returns all columns in the SampleEvent-related tables.}

\item{mon_status}{Quoted string. Allows you to select different sampling event status types. Default is "NGPN_VS",
which will pull in sample events coded a NGPN Plant Community Monitoring (see description for NGPN_VS below). Note
that in the data, the status name starts with year. For simplicity, the years argument pulls out specific years,
and mon_status to pull out different status types without considering year. Valid inputs:
\itemize{
\item{"NGPN_VS":} {Default. Pulls in records with status of "####_PlantCommunity", "####_FirePlantCommunity", "####_ForestStructure", #### representing year.}
\item{"PlantCommunity":} {####_PlantCommunity only records}
\item{"FirePlantCommunity":} {####_FirePlantCommunity only records}
\item{"ForestStructure":} {####_ForestStructure only records}

\value{
Returns a data frame of sample event data
}
\description{
This function filters FFI sample event data by park, plot name, project, purpose,
and year. This function was primarily developed to pull out NGPN plant community
monitoring plots and NGPN PCM vital signs sampling events. Using combinations of plot names,
projects or purposes that are outside NGPN PCM plots hasn't been tested as thoroughly, and may
not return intended results in every case. Note that plots in the MacroPlot table that don't have
a corresponding record in the SampleEvent table are not returned. Note that this is more
of an internal function that other data-related getter functions source to correctly link table and
filter on records.
