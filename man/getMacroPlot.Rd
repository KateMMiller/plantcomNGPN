\arguments{
\item{park}{Filter on park code (aka RegistrationUnit_Name). Can select more than one. Valid inputs:
\itemize{
\item{"all":} {Include all NGPN parks with FFI data}
\item{"AGFO":} {Agate Fossil Beds National Monument}

}}

\item{plot_name}{Quoted string to return a particular plot based on MacroPlot_Name. Default is "all", which if
purpose is set to "NGPN_PCM" (default), and project is set to "Park" (default), then only NGPN Plant Community
Monitoring plots (e.g.,macroplots with "_PCM_", "_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_" in their names) will be included.
Can select multiple plots. If a plot name is specified that does not occur in the imported data,
function will error out with a list of unmatched plot names.}

\item{project}{Quoted string to return plots of a particular project, based on ProjectUnit_Name. In NGPN, this
typically is the strata a given plot belongs to. By default, selects "NGPN_PCM" plots, which are plots with
c("_PCM_", "_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_") in their name and the "Park" stratum for those plots. Note that some
plots fall in multiple stratum, such as Park and Native Prairie in AGFO. In those cases, the Park strata is
selected by default. If a user wants a different strata than "Park", that can be specified using the codes below.
If new projects are added in the future, they will need to be added to the bug handling code in the function.
Valid inputs:
\itemize{
\item{'all':} {Pull in all project types.}
\item{"Park":} {Default. *NGPN_PCM* stratum covering whole park.}
\item{"ABAM":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in WICA.}

\item{"Cedar Removal Study":} {*NGPN_PCM* in MNRR.}

\item{"Fort":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in FOUS.}
\item{"Monitoring"} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in MNRR.}
\item{"Native Prairie":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in AGFO.}
\item{"North Riparian":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in THRO.}
\item{"North Upland":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in THRO.}
\item{"North Unit":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in BADL.}
\item{"Pine Forest":} {*NGPN_PCM* stratum in DETO, JECA, MORU, and WICA.}

\item{purpose}{Quoted string to return plots with a particular purpose, which typically refers to a characteristic
of the plot's sample design in NGPN (e.g., Panel1). Note that purpose is not standard across parks. This function
standardizes some purposes (eg "FX" and "Fire Effects" are both called "FX monitoring"). The following purposes
that can be specified are below. By default, "NGPN_PCM" plots are selected, which includes all plots with c("_PCM_",
"_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_") in their name. If new purposes are added in the future, they will need to be added
to the bug handling code in the function. Valid inputs:
\itemize{
\item{"all":} {All plots in imported FFI database}
\item{"NGPN_PCM":} {Default. NGPN Plant Community Monitoring Plots with c("_PCM_", "_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and, "_RCM_") in their name}

\item{output}{Quoted string. Options are "short" (default), which only returns most important columns;
"verbose" returns all columns in the MacroPlot database table.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame of macroplots
}
\description{
This function filters FFI macroplot data by park, plot name, project, and purpose.
This function was primarily developed to pull out NGPN plant community monitoring plots. Using
combinations of plot names, projects or purposes that are outside NGPN PCM plots hasn't been
tested as thoroughly, and may not return intended results in every case. Note that this is more
of an internal function that other data-related getter functions source to correctly link table and
filter on records. Note that table names at the beginning of column names are dropped from output
for easier coding/analysis.
