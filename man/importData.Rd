\description{
Imports data from FFI SQL Server database or csvs of FFI database tables using the schmema designed for
the Northern Great Plains Network plant community monitoring protocol. Currently can only import from a local installation
of a park FFI database in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), but the goal is to add an option for importing directly
from the SQL Server where the production FFI databases are housed. If multiple parks worth of data are imported, tables
are row binded, so that all NPGN parks can be queried, summarized, etc. at once.
