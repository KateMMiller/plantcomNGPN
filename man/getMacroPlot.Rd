\arguments{
\item{park}{Filter on park code (aka RegistrationUnit_Name). Can select more than one. Valid inputs:

\item{plot_name}{Quoted string to return a particular plot based on name. Default is "all", which if
purpose is set to "NGPN_VS" (default), and project is set to "Park" (default), then only NGPN Plant Community
Monitoring plots (e.g.,macroplots with "_PCM_", "_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_" in their names) will be included.
Can select multiple plots. If a plot name is specified that does not occur in the imported data,
function will error out with a list of unmatched plot names.}

\item{project}{Quoted string to return plots of a particular project, based on ProjectUnit_Name. In NGPN, this
typically is the strata a given plot belongs to. By default, selects "NGPN_VS" plots, which are plots with
c("_PCM_", "_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_") in their name and the "Park" stratum for those plots. Note that some
plots fall in multiple stratum, such as Park and Native Prairie in AGFO. In those cases, the Park strata is
selected by default. If a user wants a different strata than "Park", that can be specified using the codes below.

\item{purpose}{Quoted string to return plots with a particular purpose, which typically refers to a characteristic
of the plot's sample design in NGPN (e.g., Panel1). Note that purpose is not standard across parks. This function
standardizes some purposes (eg "FX" and "Fire Effects" are both called "FX monitoring"). The following purposes
that can be specified are below. By default, "NGPN_VS" plots are selected, which includes all plots with c("_PCM_",
"_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_") in their name.

\value{
Returns a data frame of macroplots
}
\description{
This function filters FFI macroplot data by park, plot name, project, and purpose.
This function was primarily developed to pull out NGPN plant community monitoring plots. Using
combinations of plot names, projects or purposes that are outside NGPN PCM plots hasn't been
tested as thoroughly, and may not return intended results in every case. Note that this is more
of an internal function that other data-related get files source to correctly link table and
filter on records.
