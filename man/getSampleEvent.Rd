\item{plot_name}{Quoted string to return a particular plot based on MacroPlot_Name. Default is "all", which if
purpose is set to "NGPN_PCM" (default), and project is set to "Park" (default), then only NGPN Plant Community
Monitoring plots (e.g.,macroplots with "_PCM_", "_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_" in their names) will be included.
Can select multiple plots. If a plot name is specified that does not occur in the imported data,
function will error out with a list of unmatched plot names.}

\item{project}{Quoted string to return plots of a particular project, based on ProjectUnit_Name. In NGPN, this
typically is the strata a given plot belongs to. By default, selects "NGPN_PCM" plots, which are plots with
c("_PCM_", "_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_") in their name and the "Park" stratum for those plots. Note that some
plots fall in multiple stratum, such as Park and Native Prairie in AGFO. In those cases, the Park strata is
selected by default. If a user wants a different strata than "Park", that can be specified using the codes below.
If new projects are added in the future, they will need to be added to the bug handling code in the function.
Valid inputs:
\itemize{
\item{'all':} {Pull in all project types.}
\item{"Park":} {Default. *NGPN_PCM* stratum covering whole park.}

\item{purpose}{Quoted string to return plots with a particular purpose, which typically refers to a characteristic
of the plot's sample design in NGPN (e.g., Panel1). Note that purpose is not standard across parks. This function
standardizes some purposes (eg "FX" and "Fire Effects" are both called "FX monitoring"). The following purposes
that can be specified are below. By default, "NGPN_PCM" plots are selected, which includes all plots with c("_PCM_",
"_FPCM_", "_LPCM_", and "_RCM_") in their name. If new purposes are added in the future, they will need to be added
to the bug handling code in the function. Valid inputs:
\itemize{

\item{mon_status}{Quoted string. Allows you to select different MonitoringStatus$MonitoringStatus_Base types. Default is "NGPN_PCM",
which will pull in sample events coded a NGPN Plant Community Monitoring (see description for NGPN_PCM below).
If new monitoring statuses are added, they will need to be added to the bug handling code in the function.
Note that until the Monitoring Status data are cleaned up (either in the SampleEvent or MonitoringStatus table,
blank monitoring status codes will also be returned by default.
Valid inputs:
\itemize{
\item{"NGPN_PCM":} {Default. Pulls in records with monitoring status base of "PlantCommunity", "FirePlantCommunity", "ForestStructure".
Note that some base names have _, spaces, or years in them. These are cleaned up in the function until they're fixed in the databse.}
\item{"PlantCommunity":} {####_PlantCommunity only records}
\item{"FirePlantCommunity":} {####_FirePlantCommunity only records}
\item{"ForestStructure":} {####_ForestStructure only records}

\item{years}{Numeric. Filter on years. Accepted values start at 1997. Default is 2011 to current year,
which represents the time NGPN plant community monitoring began using latest protocol and sample design.}

\item{complete_events}{Logical. If TRUE (Default) only returns sample events with associated sample data
(eg Cover Point Data). If FALSE, returns all sample events with a record in the SampleEvent table.
+++++ NOT YET ENABLED +++++}

\item{output}{Quoted string. Options are "short" (default), which only returns most important columns;
"verbose" returns all columns in the SampleEvent-related tables.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame of sample event data
}
\description{
This function filters FFI sample event data by park, plot name, project, purpose,
and year. This function was primarily developed to pull out NGPN plant community
monitoring plots and NGPN PCM vital signs sampling events. Using combinations of plot names,
projects or purposes that are outside NGPN PCM plots hasn't been tested as thoroughly, and may
not return intended results in every case. Plots in the MacroPlot table that don't have
a corresponding record in the SampleEvent table are not returned unless complete_events = F. Note that this is more
of an internal function that other data-related getter functions source to correctly link table and
filter on records.
