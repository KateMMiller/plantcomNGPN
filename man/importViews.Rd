\usage{
importViews(new_env = T, import_path = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{new_env}{Logical. If TRUE (default), will import tables to VIEWS_NGPN environment.
If FALSE, will import tables to global environment.}

\item{import_path}{Quoted string to import a zipped file of views. The name of the zipped file should be included
in the path. Can specify multiple paths to import multiple parks/projects.}
}
\value{
Either an environment with views as data frames for each imported database, or database
tables directly in the global environment.
}
\description{
This function imports flattened views of the FFI data for NGPN PCM monitoring.
The views were generated by the importData() function and exported as a zip file,
and will contain data from all parks imported via importData(). By importing a zip file of csvs,
this function is much faster than importing the individual tables from each FFI SQL database
and joining them together to create the views. This option also saves having to set up software
to work with SQL servers, and works seamlessly with package functions just like the
the importData() function.
